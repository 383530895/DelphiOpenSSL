# Delphi OpenSSL Library

[Delphi](http://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi) implementation of OpenSSL.

## Features

- Encrypt/Decrypt using RSA algorithm
- Symmetric cipher routines (for now only AES256)
- Base64 encoding e decoding
- Basic PAM support

## Todo

- Symmetric cryptography (partially done)
- compute hash functions
- Sign e verify
- Generation of pseudo-random bit strings
- RSA data management
- Data managing for X509
- Manage information according to the PKCS #12 standard

## Prerequisite

OpenSSL library must be in your system path

## Installation

- Add the source path "Source" to your Delphi project path
- Run the demo and follow the tutorial
